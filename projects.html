                    distance of all the major employment areas of Austin, Texas, the fastest growing city in 
                    America.

                    The tract has great road frontage and it’s location made it perfect for highly sought after 
                    country homesites. We surveyed the property out into six such homesites ranging from 
                    10 – 22 acres tracts and sold them for prices ranging from $89,000 to $159,000. The 
                    price per acre was well under similar properties in the immediate market area. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    One such project located directly across the street sold out very quickly, setting the
